Hello Everyone!

I am Pavit Kaur, a 3rd year engineering student from University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University. I am someone who love to explore technology as much as I can.  
I am GSoC '21 student and would be sharing my journey of GSoC in my blogs. If you are someone interested in Open Source, do check them out!
