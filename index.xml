      <description>Hello Everyone!
I am Pavit Kaur, a 3rd year engineering student from University Institute of Engineering and Technology, Panjab University. I am someone who love to explore technology as much as I can.
I am GSoC &amp;lsquo;21 student and would be sharing my journey of GSoC in my blogs. If you are someone interested in Open Source, do check them out!</description>

      <description>I am really excited that my Google Summer of Code proposal with Debian for the project “Debian Continuous Integration improvements” has been accepted. Through this blog, I am here to share about my Pre-GSoC journey.
I knew about GSoC since my first year of college but had this misconception that only great coders get selected for GSoC which did not let me apply to the program until my 3rd year of engineering.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t think they tried to market it to the billionaire, spelunking, base-jumping crowd. i did the same thing to gandhi, he didn&amp;rsquo;t eat for three weeks. i once heard a wise man say there are no perfect men.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
